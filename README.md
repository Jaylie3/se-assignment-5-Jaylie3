10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
    Here is how you can integrate Git with VS Code for version control:
- Download and Install Git: Visit [https://git-scm.com/]. Download the Git executable for your operating system. Then, run it with default settings.
- Open a Git repository: VS Code provides several ways to get started in a Git repository, from local to remote cloud-powered environments like GitHub Codespaces.
- Initialize a repository in a local folder: Open an existing or new folder on your computer and open it in VS Code. Then select the Initialize Repository button in the Source Control view.
- Staging and committing code changes: Once you have a Git repository set up, you can start tracking code changes by staging and committing your newly created and edited code.
- Pushing and pulling remote changes: Once you have made commits to your local Git repository, you can push them to the remote repository. The Sync Changes button indicates how many commits are going to be pushed and pulled.
- Using branches: In Git, branches allow you to work on multiple versions of your codebase simultaneously. This is useful for experimenting with new features or making large code changes without affecting the main codebase.
- Creating and reviewing GitHub pull requests: In Git and GitHub, pull requests (PRs) are a way for collaborators to review and merge code changes from separate branches into the main branch.
